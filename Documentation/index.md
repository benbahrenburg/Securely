<h1>BenCoding.Securely</h1>

Securely provides building blocks to create secure Titanium apps.

The following proxy objects allow for you to build a composible cross-platform security layer to meet your various security requirements.


<h2>Before you start</h2>
* These are iOS and Android native modules designed to work with Titanium SDK 3.0.0.GA
* Before using this module you first need to install the package. If you need instructions on how to install a 3rd party module please read this installation guide.

<h2>Download the compiled release</h2>

Download the platform you wish to use:

* [iOS Dist](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Securely/tree/master/iOS/dist)
* [Android Dist](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Securely/tree/master/Android/dist)

<h2>Building from source?</h2>

If you are building from source you will need to do the following:

Import the project into Xcode:

* Modify the titanium.xcconfig file with the path to your Titanium installation

Import the project into Eclipse:

* Update the .classpath
* Update the build properties

<h2>Setup</h2>

* Download the latest release from the releases folder ( or you can build it yourself )
* Install the bencoding.securely module. If you need help here is a "How To" [guide](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Configuring+Apps+to+Use+Modules). 
* You can now use the module via the commonJS require method, example shown below.

<pre><code>
var securely = require('bencoding.securely');
</code></pre>

<h2>Creating the Securely Module Object</h2>

Requiring the module into your project

<pre><code>
//Require the securely module into your project
var securely = require('bencoding.securely');
</code></pre>

<h2>Secure Properties</h2>

The Securely Properties module is used to store values in the KeyChain using the same API as Titanium.App.Properties.
